# End-to-End Text-to-SQL LLM App

This project is an end-to-end application that converts natural language text queries into SQL queries using a Large Language Model (LLM). It integrates Google Gemini Pro to power the natural language understanding and SQL generation capabilities. The app also includes functionality to query an SQL database and retrieve results based on the generated SQL queries.

## Introduction

The "End-to-End Text-to-SQL LLM App" is designed to streamline the process of querying databases using natural language. By leveraging the capabilities of Google Gemini Pro, this application can take a user's natural language query, translate it into SQL, execute the SQL query against a connected database, and return the results in a user-friendly format.

## Features

- **Natural Language to SQL**: Automatically translate text-based queries into SQL statements using a trained LLM.
- **SQL Execution**: Execute the generated SQL queries on an SQL database and return the results.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive interface for users to input their queries.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback on invalid or unsupported queries.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different databases and configurations.

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture:

1. **Frontend**: User interface for inputting queries and displaying results.
2. **Backend**: Handles the logic for processing natural language, generating SQL queries, and executing them against the database.
3. **Database**: The SQL database where queries are executed.
4. **Google Gemini Pro Integration**: Utilizes Google Gemini Pro's LLM to translate natural language into SQL.

## Installation
